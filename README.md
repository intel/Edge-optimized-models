## Object detection models for Computer Vision based applications

|Model | Description|
|-----| ---------|
 |MobileNet 1-Class detection | Detects and locates multiple instances of a class of object in an input image with low latency. Based on [SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) and [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) architectures. Trained to detect Pedestrians.|
 |MobileNet 5-Class detection| Detects and locates multiple instances of objects belonging to five classes. Based on [SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) and [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) architectures. Trained to detect Pedestrians, Cars, Buses, Bicycles and Motorcycles.|
 |SqueezeNet 5-Class detection| Detects and locates multiple instances of objects belonging to five classes. Based on [SSD](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) and [SqueezeNet](https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet) architectures. Trained to detect Pedestrians, Cars, Buses, Bicycles and Motorcycles.|
